# Events Documentation

This section contains sequence diagrams showing various flows and operations in the Cluster IQ system.

## Sequence Diagrams

- [Power Action Sequence](power-action-sequence.md) - Shows the abstracted flow for cluster power operations (PowerOn/PowerOff) through the system

## Reading Diagrams

All sequence diagrams are written in Mermaid format which is natively supported by GitHub. They should render automatically when viewing in GitHub's web interface.

If you're viewing these diagrams locally or in an environment that doesn't support Mermaid, you can use:

- [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)
- VS Code with Mermaid extension
- Any Markdown viewer with Mermaid support
